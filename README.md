Face Detection in MATLAB 

Here I have used CascadeObjectDetector System object of Computer Vision Toolbox in Matlab, 
to detect multiple faces in a test image, create a bounding box and annotate a string name to it.

The cascade object detector uses the Viola-Jones algorithm to detect peopleâ€™s faces, noses, eyes, mouth, or upper body. 
You can also use the Image Labeler to train a custom classifier to use with this System object.
